	<h2>DEFINITION OF AIRCRAFT:</h2>
	<hr>
		<p>An airplane, or aeroplane, informally plane, is a <b>fixed-wing aircraft</b> that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller, or rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations.</p>
	</hr>
	<h2>FIRST AIRCRAFT:</h2>
		<p>The <b>Wright brothers</b> inaugurated the aerial age with the world's first successful flights of a powered heavier-than-air flying machine. The Wright Flyer was the product of a sophisticated four-year program of research and development conducted by Wilbur and Orville Wright beginning in <b>1899</b>. After building and testing three full-sized gliders, the Wrights' first powered airplane flew at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on <b>December 17, 1903</b>, making a 12-second flight, traveling 36 m (120 ft), with Orville piloting. The best flight of the day, with Wilbur at the controls, covered 255.6 m (852 ft) in 59 seconds.</p>
